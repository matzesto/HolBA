Symbolic Execution on HolBA:

# 0 Preprocesssing: (SML)
 + Remove conditional jumps by calculating all possible jump targets based on preconditions
 + Ignore conditional memory reads, since only the formula exploads, 
   but this is not our problem
 + after preprocessing, we assume we know the control flow of the program

# 1 Define Symbolic State: (HOL)
 + Same Environment, Memory, Initially Registes map to Symbolic Values (Types?)
 + collect Path Predicate

 + Expression evaluation remains as in concrete execution, except on conditional jumps:
  - fork when this happens
  - do not fork, if we can exclude one jump target based on condition and environment



# 2 Execute Code using existing code (HOL) 
 + EVAL program

# 3 Collect Path Predicate (SML)
